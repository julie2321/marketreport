One technology that is playing a crucial role in this shift is&nbsp;<strong>Variable Data Printing (VDP)</strong>.

<h3>What is Variable Data Printing (VDP)?</h3>
<p>Variable Data Printing is a form of digital printing that allows businesses to customize individual prints, such as flyers, brochures, or labels, with unique data. This data can include names, addresses, customer-specific images, or special offers, enabling businesses to create highly targeted marketing materials. Unlike traditional offset printing, which requires a static design for all prints, VDP offers a higher level of customization, enhancing the relevancy and impact of each printed piece.</p>
